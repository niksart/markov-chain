# markov-chain
Simple tool that generates a markov chain based language.

## Current implementations:
- initialization of a MC passing the transition probability matrix, the initial distribution and the labels of the states
- text generation following the rules of the instantiated MC
- calculation of the TPM after n steps (TPM^n)
